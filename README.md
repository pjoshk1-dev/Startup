> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

My startup will be a competitive card game where you can collect cards with different unique abilities and use them in battles with your friends. Each card you collect will be added to your deck, from which you can trade or destroy them to optimize your build. You then use them in battles against other players to collect more, and the cycle continues.

### Design

![Design image](startup_design.jpg)

Top Left: Main menu. All buttons will be grayed out aside from login and sign up until the user does so. Top Right: Card collection screen. Users can view their cards, choose which ones are in their deck, trade with friends, and destroy extra cards for rewards. Bottom Left: Battle screen. Players can see cards in their hand, how many their opponent has, and the effects of cards change the play area in real time. Bottom Right: Friend list. Users can add friends through usernames saved on the database and see which of their friends are online, offer trades, or challenge them to battles.
